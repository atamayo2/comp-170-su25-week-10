my assignment code was kind of similar but i still think i am constantly making the same issues. 
now looking back and writing my course reflection i see how im constantly not adding more explanations in the codes.
So when i am going back to for help or to see what i did and why i dont understand because of the missing explanations.
I am currently working on my project and know that is something i need to do better on so i can finish strong and hopfully get an A.
