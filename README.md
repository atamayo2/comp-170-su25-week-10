# COMP 170 SU25 WEEK 10

This assignment has two parts: a reflection part to evaluate work you have already submitted and **a reflection to evaluation your overall work and propose your final grade for the course.**


## Finals week policy

There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. 

These meetings will be scheduled on **Wednesday August 6, from 11 AM to 1 PM** in 15-minute slots. If you are selected, randomly, for an oral followup, you will be notified by email on Monday 8/4/25 at 11 AM.



## Reflect

Review the [posted solutions from the previous assignment](./solutions_week09.py). Compare the posted solutions with your solutions. Notice the differences between your code and the solutions code and describe them. Trivial differences like the names of variables are not that important.
